## AFImageDownloader
A simple image downloader for iOS. Still working on completing it. It's a personal side project and challenge I'm working on: can I develop a small library that will fetch and decompress JPEGs efficiently completely using Behaviour-Driven Development with [Kiwi](https://github.com/allending/Kiwi)? I didn't let the app touch the Internet until it was completely done. The first time I ran it, it worked.

Downloads JPEG images asynchronously and decompresses them on a background thread.

## Testing

Make sure to do a recursive checkout to get the [Kiwi](https://github.com/allending/Kiwi) testing frameworking.

    git checkout --recursive git://github.com/AshFurrow/AFImageDownloader.git
