## AFImageDownloader
A simple image downloader for iOS. Still working on completing it. It's a personal side project and challenge I'm working on: can I develop a small library that will fetch and decompress JPEGs efficiently completely using Behaviour-Driven Development with [Kiwi](https://github.com/allending/Kiwi)? I'm not letting the code touch the Internet until it's completely done.

Downloads JPEG images asynchronously and decompresses them on a background thread.

## TODOs

1. Needs to turn JPEG into UIImage in background thread.
